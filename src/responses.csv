Happy Birthday yaayyyyyy and thank you so much for everything you done so far. The first time i started to watch you i knew it that your going to be my favourite VTuber. I really like your art, character and your soft, lovley voice.  Everytime when i watch your stream i forget everything in my mind and just having fun watching you. Your actually helped me a lot with your character and thats why you are special for me. Even tho i'm a boy i want to be like you i literally look up at you. Have a nice birthday party with your friends and a lot of fun 

Dear Fufu"

Happy birthday to Nanakagura-sensei and Kaguranana!
Last year you achieved a goal that you set yourself and it was very impressive.
I'm sure that you will be expanding your activities more and more in the future, and I will continue to root for you.
