Happy Birthday yaayyyyyy and thank you so much for everything you done so far. The first time i started to watch you i knew it that your going to be my favourite VTuber. I really like your art, character and your soft, lovley voice.  Everytime when i watch your stream i forget everything in my mind and just having fun watching you. Your actually helped me a lot with your character and thats why you are special for me. Even tho i'm a boy i want to be like you i literally look up at you. Have a nice birthday party with your friends and a lot of fun 

Dear Fufu",,

Loved those times you would chat with everyone in Discord when you came by. I know it must be tough being an artist/content creator, it might be discouraging sometimes, but I hope you continue to push through! Know that I will always cheer for you! Keep doing you, and we'll be here if you ever need to talk or something (though I doubt I'll be of much help XD). 頑張れナナ！",,
